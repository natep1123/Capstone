## Idea 1: Weather App with Astronomy Tracking
This is my favorite idea. This is an idea I have had for a long time and always hoped someone would build it.
### Summary:
Use public weather and astronomy APIs to make a one-page display of the user's local weather, but also moon phase tracking, sky visibility rating, constellations overhead, and cloud coverage. Features include: current local weather status, 10-day local forecast, moon phase tracking, cloud coverage report, constellation report with star visibility rating and reports of upcoming astronomical events like eclipses and meteor showers.
### Problem: 
For those with passion for astronomy, a standard weather app is not enough. They lack astronomical-tracking features such as moon phases, visibility rating for the night sky, reports about upcoming significant astronomical events, and constellation tracking for which constellations are in the sky. 
### Solution: 
Bringing together reports for both terrestrial and astronimcal weather, an app that shows not only local weather weather reporting but also astronomical tracking would be a one-stop-all for astronomy hobbiest and everyday use alike.

## Idea 2: Trail Finder App with Weather Companion
### Summary: 
App to locate nearby hiking trails while also gathering a weather report for the area so that hikers can make more informed decisions about where to hike. Features include warnings to not hike areas that are experiencing poor weather conditions, best times to hike for best weather and gear/equipment recommendations for preparedness.
### Problem: 
It can be hard to find the best hike when weather is unpredictable, making it even more difficult for hikers to stay prepared and make informed decisions about when to hike, whether or not it is safe and what equipment may be best suited for the terrain and conditions. 
### Solution: 
An app to generate local hiking trails and also a local weather report for each trail so that hikers can make real-time compparisons of trails to make the most informed decisions! Find the best hikes for cloudy days or sunny days, or see an alert to reconsider hiking certain trails if their local winds speeds are too high or weather is otherwise hazardous. Find safe alternative hikes recommended if the weather is hazardous for others.
