## Idea 1: Weather App with Astronomy Tracking
This is my favorite idea. This is an idea I have had for a long time and always hoped someone would build it.
### Summary:
App with one-page display of reports for the user's local weather, moon phase tracking, sky visibility rating, constellations overhead, and cloud coverage. Features include: current local weather status, 10-day local forecast, moon phase tracking, cloud coverage report, constellation report with star visibility rating and reports of upcoming astronomical events like eclipses and meteor showers.
### Problem: 
For those with passion for astronomy, a standard weather app is not enough. They lack astronomical-tracking features such as moon phases, visibility rating for the night sky, reports about upcoming significant astronomical events, and constellation tracking for which constellations are in the sky. 
### Solution: 
Bringing together reports for both terrestrial and astronimcal weather, an app that shows not only local weather weather reporting but also astronomical tracking would be a one-stop-all for astronomy hobbiest and everyday use alike.

## Idea 2: Trail Finder App with Weather Companion
### Summary: 
App to locate nearby hiking trails while also gathering a weather report for the area so that hikers can make more informed decisions about where to hike. Features include warnings to not hike areas that are experiencing poor weather conditions, best times to hike for best weather and gear/equipment recommendations for preparedness.
### Problem: 
It can be hard to find the best hikes when weather is unpredictable, making it even more difficult for hikers to stay prepared and make informed decisions about when and where to hike. Informed decisions also include whether or not it is safe and what equipment may be best suited for the terrain/conditions. 
### Solution: 
An app to generate local hiking trails and also a local weather reporting for each trail so that hikers can make real-time comparisons of trails to make the most informed decisions! Find the best hikes for cloudy days or sunny days, or see an alert to avoid certain trails if their local winds speeds are too high or weather is otherwise hazardous. Also recommend safe alternative hikes if the weather is hazardous for others.

## Idea 3: Roadtrip Roulette
### Summary: 
App to offer roadtrip reroutes based on user preferences for activities/sites along the way. (Ex. user inputs their desired- and starting-locations and the app provides 1: the fastest route with "on-the-way" activity/site suggestions (or none) as a baseline for comparison, and 2: a selection of other possible routes that visit different sites/attractions complete with the total time it would add compared to the fastest route. All recommended stops tailored to user interests.
### Problem: 
Roadtrips can be boring and planning a fun roadtrip with activities and ssites along the way can be quite time consuming.
### Solution: 
This app would make planning a roadtrip easy and fun. It would connect users with routes that not only route them to their destination, but also provides fun stops along the way tailored to their interests.
